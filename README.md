## About this repository ##

This repository is adapted from Ableton's
[push2-display-with-juce](https://github.com/Ableton/push2-display-with-juce)
repo.


### Note ###

The low-level classes used to communicate with the display are _not_ tied to
JUCE in any way. This means they can be extracted from this example and used in
another framework if desired.


### License ###

This software is distributed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE).


### Dependencies ###

In order to communicate over USB, this example uses
[libusb](http://www.libusb.org/). On MacOS and Windows, libusb is compiled as
part of the example. On Linux, you will need to use your favorite package
manager to install the development package; for example,

`sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev`

Note that if you ship an application using libusb, you should ensure that you
respect their
[licensing terms](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html).

On Linux, you will also need to
[fetch the packages needed for JUCE](https://forum.juce.com/t/list-of-juce-dependencies-under-linux/15121).


## How do I get set up? ##

### Setting up the repository ###

Clone the repo (including the submodules for JUCE and libusb):

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/khiner/sound-machine.git`


### Building ###

The example uses the standard JUCE folder structure and, although it doesn't
make any sound, is based on the "Audio Application" template from the
Introjucer.

There are projects ready for CLion, located in the `Builds` folder.


### Running ###

Once the program is compiled, running it will open a window on the computer's
screen and display an animation on the Push display. As a bonus, the computer
window will display MIDI messages generated by touching the Push 2 pads,
buttons, and knobs.

### Customization ###

If you would like to quickly hack some drawing of your own, have a look at the
`Demo::drawFrame()` method in `sound-machine/Source/Push2Demo.cpp`.
