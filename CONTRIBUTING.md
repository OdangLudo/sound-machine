# Contributing

The [Trello project board](https://trello.com/b/a6qgqDRP/flowgrid) is publicly readable and privately editable.
There are always lots of tickets open at many levels of complexity.
So far I'm the only contributor to this project, but if anything in there looks so interesting that you'd like to help make it, I'd be more than happy to:
* discuss the project with you and elaborate on any of the cards in the above Trello
* discuss and review PRs that address anything in the above Trello
* discuss suggestions or ideas for new features/improvements/directions

If you're building and playing with this, and run into a bug, or something surprising, or have any thoughts or suggestions, or any questions about the project please feel free to create a GH issue, or to contact me at karl.hiner@gmail.com!
