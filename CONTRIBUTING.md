# Contributing

The [Trello project board](https://trello.com/b/a6qgqDRP/flowgrid) is publicly readable and privately editable.
There are always lots of tickets open at many levels of complexity.
So far I'm the only contributor to this project, but if anything in there looks so interesting that you'd like to help make it, I'd be more than happy to do any of the following:
* discuss the project with you and elaborate on any of the cards in the above Trello
* discuss and review PRs that address anything in the above Trello

Please feel free to contact me at karl.hiner@gmail.com with any questions about the project!
